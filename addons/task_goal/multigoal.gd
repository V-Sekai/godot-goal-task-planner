#	"""
#	g = Multigoal(goal_name, **kwargs) creates an object that represents
#	a conjunctive goal, i.e., the goal of reaching a state that contains
#	all of the state-variable bindings in g.
#	  - goal_name is the name to use for the new multigoal.
#	  - The keyword args are name and desired values of state variables.
#
#	Example: here are three equivalent ways to specify a goal named 'goal1'
#	in which boxes b and c are located in room2 and room3:
#		First:
#		   g = Multigoal('goal1')
#		   g.loc = {}   # create a dictionary for things like loc['b']
#		   g.loc['b'] = ss'room2'
#		   g.loc['c'] = 'room3'
#		Second:
#		   g = Multigoal('goal1', loc={})
#		   g.loc['b'] = 'room2'
#		   g.loc['c'] = 'room3'
#		Third:
#		   g = Multigoal('goal1',loc={'b':'room2', 'c':'room3'})
