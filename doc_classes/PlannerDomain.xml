		The [PlannerDomain] in which goals are to be achieved.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [PlannerDomain] represents the environment or context of a [PlannerPlan] in which multiple actions, goals, [PlannerMultigoal]s, and tasks need to be achieved.
		Actions and methods are typically defined as functions (e.g., in GDScript, or C++ static/member functions exposed as [Callable]s) and then registered with the domain. Their preconditions are usually implemented as conditional logic within these functions.
		The functions wrapped by these [Callable]s should adhere to the following conventions:
		- [b]Action/Command functions[/b]: Their arguments representing the current state and action parameters should be treated as read-only (e.g., by not modifying input Dictionaries directly but working on copies if changes are needed). They must return false if the action is not applicable, or a new [Dictionary] representing the state after the action is applied (state changes).
		- [b]Method functions[/b] (unigoal, task, multigoal): Their arguments should also be treated as read-only. They must return false if the method is not applicable, or an [Array] of sub-tasks/sub-goals (todo list) to indicate success. An empty [Array] can signify that the method/goal/task was achieved with no further steps.

		<method name="add_actions">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="actions" type="Callable[]" />
			<description>
				Adds a list of [Callable]s representing actions to the domain. Each [Callable] should refer to a function whose arguments are treated as read-only (the first usually being the current state [Dictionary]) and which returns false if the action is not applicable, or a new [Dictionary] representing the state after the action (state changes).

		<method name="add_multigoal_methods">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="methods" type="Callable[]" />
			<description>
				Adds a list of [Callable]s representing methods for achieving multigoals. Each [Callable] should refer to a function whose arguments are treated as read-only (e.g., current state [Dictionary], the [PlannerMultigoal]) and which returns a [Variant]. The [Variant] should be false if the method is not applicable, or an [Array] of sub-tasks/goals (todo list) if it is.

		<method name="add_task_methods">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="task_name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="methods" type="Callable[]" />
			<description>
				Adds a list of [Callable]s representing methods for a specific task_name. Each [Callable] should refer to a function whose arguments are treated as read-only (the first usually being the current state [Dictionary], followed by task-specific arguments) and which returns a [Variant]. The [Variant] should be false if the method is not applicable, or an [Array] of sub-tasks/goals (todo list) if it is.

			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="task_name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="methods" type="Callable[]" />
			<description>
				Adds a list of [Callable]s representing methods for achieving a specific unigoal (identified by task_name, which is often the state variable the unigoal targets). Each [Callable] should refer to a function whose arguments are treated as read-only (e.g., current state [Dictionary], goal-specific arguments) and which returns a [Variant]. The [Variant] should be false if the method is not applicable, or an [Array] of sub-tasks/goals (todo list) if it is applicable.

			<return type="Variant" />
			<param index="0" name="state" type="Dictionary" />

			<param index="6" name="verbose" type="int" />
			<description>
				A static helper method to verify if a specific unigoal condition (state_var, arguments, desired_values) is met in the given state after a method was applied. Returns an empty [Array] if the goal is achieved, or false otherwise. Used for debugging and plan verification, potentially logging information based on verbose level.
