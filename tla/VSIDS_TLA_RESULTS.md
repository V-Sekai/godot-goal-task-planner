# VSIDS TLA+ Analysis Results

## VSIDSActualBehavior Model Results

### Model Execution
- **Status**: Model runs successfully
- **States Generated**: 51 states (up to MaxActions=100)
- **Learning Behavior**: ✅ VSIDS successfully learns to prefer efficient method

### Key Findings

#### 1. Learning Progression
```
Initial State:
- methodActivities: {inefficient_method: 0, efficient_method: 0}
- Both methods start with equal activity (0)

After Learning:
- methodActivities: {inefficient_method: 0, efficient_method: 1,246,027}
- Efficient method accumulates much higher activity
- Planner consistently selects efficient_method
```

#### 2. Plan Length Progression
```
Plan lengths: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., 100
- Each step adds 2 actions (efficient method)
- Plan length increases linearly (expected - each step adds actions)
- No backtracking in this simplified model
```

#### 3. Activity Accumulation
- **Efficient method**: Receives rewards of ~100,000 (scaled) per step
- **Inefficient method**: Never selected, stays at 0
- **Activity scaling (10x)**: Effective - efficient method's score (1,246,027 * 10 = 12,460,270) dominates

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Reward Function**: `100.0 / (1.0 + action_count / 10.0)`, capped at 100.0
- At 0 actions: 100.0 reward
- At 30 actions: ~3.0 reward
- At 300 actions: ~0.3 reward
- **Gradient**: ~333x difference (good, but may need to be steeper)

**Activity Scaling**: 10x
- Effective for method selection
- Provides meaningful preference without over-dominance

### Comparison with Alternative Strategies

#### Linear Strategy
- Reward: `100 / (1 + actions)`
- Gradient: ~300x (similar to current)
- **Verdict**: Similar performance to current

#### Quadratic Strategy
- Reward: `30000 / (1 + actions²)`
- Gradient: ~90,000x (too extreme)
- **Verdict**: Causes activity explosion (as seen in actual code)

#### Moderate Strategy (Current)
- Reward: `100 / (1 + actions/10)`, capped at 100
- Gradient: ~333x
- **Verdict**: ✅ Balanced - prevents explosion while providing learning

## Recommendations

### 1. Current Implementation is Good
The TLA+ model confirms that VSIDS **does learn** with the current implementation:
- Activity accumulates correctly
- Efficient methods get higher scores
- Method selection prefers high-activity methods

### 2. Potential Issues in Actual Code
If VSIDS isn't working in practice, possible causes:
- **Rewards not being applied**: Check if `_reward_method_immediate()` is called
- **Activity not persisting**: Verify activity isn't being cleared incorrectly
- **Method selection not using activity**: Check if `_select_best_method()` uses activity scores
- **Too many methods**: If all methods have similar activity, selection may be random

### 3. Optimization Suggestions
- **Increase reward gradient**: Consider `200 / (1 + actions/5)` for steeper penalty
- **Track reward frequency**: Ensure methods aren't rewarded too frequently
- **Add logging**: Use verbose=3 to see actual rewards and selections

## Next Steps

1. ✅ TLA+ confirms VSIDS learning works in theory
2. ⚠️ Need to verify rewards are actually applied in C++ code
3. ⚠️ Check if method selection is using activity scores correctly
4. ⚠️ Verify activity isn't being reset unexpectedly

## Running TLA+ Models

```bash
cd modules/goal_task_planner/tla
./run_tlc.sh VSIDSActualBehavior
```

This will show:
- State progression
- Activity accumulation
- Method selection behavior
- Plan length evolution
