# VSIDS Testing Status

## Changes Made (Based on Chuffed)

1. ✅ **Simplified reward calculation**: Use fixed `activity_var_inc` instead of calculated reward
2. ✅ **Activity inflation only**: Removed direct decay, use `var_inc *= 1.05`
3. ✅ **Duplicate prevention**: Track rewarded methods per solve
4. ✅ **Fixed action counting**: Use `_count_closed_actions()` instead of `extract_solution_plan()` during planning

## Current Status

### Build Status
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ No linter errors

### Test Status
- ⚠️ **Blocks World test crashes** with SIGSEGV
- ✅ **16 other tests pass** (58765 assertions passed)
- ✅ **Activity scores are reasonable** (3-15, not millions)

### Crash Details
- **Location**: `blocks_world_problem.h:288` (test case)
- **When**: After planning completes, when calling `result->extract_plan()`
- **Possible cause**: Solution graph structure issue, or crash during planning that manifests later

## Observations

### Activity Scores (Good!)
- Before: 3,000,000+ (explosive)
- After: 3-15 (reasonable) ✅

### Planning Behavior
- Planning continues for many iterations (498+)
- Methods are being selected with activity scores
- Actions are being executed
- Crash happens after planning completes

## Next Steps

1. **Debug the crash**:
   - Check if crash is in `extract_plan()` or during planning
   - Verify solution graph structure is valid
   - Check for memory corruption

2. **Verify VSIDS learning**:
   - Check if plan length decreases over iterations
   - Verify activity scores influence method selection
   - Test with simpler domain first

3. **Compare with Chuffed**:
   - Our implementation now matches Chuffed's approach
   - Activity inflation working correctly
   - Fixed increment rewards working

## Key Learnings from Chuffed

1. **Fixed increment** is simpler and proven
2. **Activity inflation** is more efficient than direct decay
3. **Conflict-based bumping** is standard approach
4. **Duplicate prevention** is critical

## Files Modified

- `plan.cpp`: Simplified rewards, activity inflation, action counting
- `plan.h`: Removed unused decay factor, added action counter
- `AGENTS.md`: Updated documentation
