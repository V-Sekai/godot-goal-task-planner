Yes, it is possible to write this as a C extension for SQLite. However, the process involves converting your GDScript code into C and then integrating it with SQLite's API.

Here's a general outline of how you might approach this:

1. **Convert your GDScript code to C**: This is the most labor-intensive part of the process. You'll need to rewrite your GDScript functions in C. Keep in mind that GDScript is a high-level language with many built-in features that aren't available in C, so some parts of your code may require significant reworking.

2. **Create a SQLite extension**: SQLite allows you to create custom extensions using C. These extensions can define new functions, collations, and virtual tables that extend the functionality of SQLite. You'll need to use SQLite's C API to integrate your code with SQLite.

3. **Define new SQL functions**: Once your C code is integrated with SQLite, you can expose your functions to SQL by using the `sqlite3_create_function()` function provided by SQLite's C API. This will allow you to call your functions from SQL queries.

4. **Compile and load your extension**: After your extension is written, you'll need to compile it into a shared library (`.so` file on Unix, `.dll` file on Windows). You can then load this library into SQLite using the `.load` command or the `sqlite3_load_extension()` function.

Please note that while it's technically possible to do this, it may not be the best solution depending on your specific needs. Writing C code requires careful memory management and error handling, and debugging C code can be more difficult than debugging GDScript code. If performance is a concern, there may be other ways to optimize your GDScript code without resorting to C.

Here's an example of how you might define a new SQL function in a SQLite extension:

```c
#include <sqlite3ext.h>
SQLITE_EXTENSION_INIT1

static void my_function(sqlite3_context *context, int argc, sqlite3_value **argv) {
    // Your code here
}

#ifdef _WIN32
__declspec(dllexport)
#endif
int sqlite3_extension_init(
    sqlite3 *db,
    char **pzErrMsg,
    const sqlite3_api_routines *pApi
){
    SQLITE_EXTENSION_INIT2(pApi)
    sqlite3_create_function(db, "my_function", 1, SQLITE_UTF8, NULL, &my_function, NULL, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `my_function` is a C function that implements your custom functionality. The `sqlite3_extension_init` function is called when the extension is loaded into SQLite, and it uses `sqlite3_create_function` to register `my_function` as a new SQL function.

Remember to replace `"my_function"` with the name of your function, and adjust the number `1` to the number of arguments your function takes.
